In the 4th Century A.C., the Church Fathers stole the secret word of the *Ancient Masters*, which symbolized the four cosmic principles of creation, changed the meaning of the "Secret Word" to indicate their God, then destroyed the ancient mysteries and the ancient literature to hide their crime, and slaughtered more than seventy million people to make the work believe in the fraud that evolved into Christianity.

Prior of its destruction of satanic despots in the 4th, 5th, & 6th Centuries A.D., a remarkable system of Cosmography had been taught for ages in the Temples of the *Ancient Masters*. For that purpose were the temples erected, and the leader of these temples known to us, was the Great Pyramid of Gizeh, built so far back in the night of time that no record of its construction has ever been discovered. This system of education was founded on fundamental principles, and scientifically expounded the constitution of the Macrocosm and the Microcosm, skillfully symbolized in the image of the Sphinx, found in all ancient nations. It revealed the secret that, at the birth of man, the Astral Garment of the Eternal Ego is a photographic representation of the planetary vibrations affecting the earth and all of its inhabitants.

The ancient Science of *Celestial Correspondence*, usually called Astrology, revealed the meaning and time-arrangement of electrons, atoms, molecules, and cells, their creation, function and related positions to one another, whether in star, nebulae, sun, earth or atom. We must always see things whole or never find that the fact that the Great Law of the Universe is One, constantly repeated by the ancient Seers, Masters and Adept's.
