      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach the
      world <em>technical sophistication</em>, which includes both "hard
      skills" like coding, command lines, and version control, and "soft
       skills" like guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and
      knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can
      benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join
